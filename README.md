# Description architecture

- We have set up a resource group in the EUW region
- A virtual network
- A public IP address on the VM
- A network security group with an SSH key
- A network interface linking everything together
- A storage disk and a storage account, both useful for SIEM.
- All this based on a virtual machine with an open SSH interface
